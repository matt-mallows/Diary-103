# Diary submission (ICS 103)
_This Project is a Work in Progress_
- The **'Diary'** is a project made to help us learn more about GUIs. We were tasked to create different JFrame Forms for the UI of the project.
  - It consists of 4 JFrame Forms. Much like a Diary, it starts with a Log-in Page for the users to input their information in.
  - After entering, it takes the user to the main panel, which they can enter their entries, including this Diary ID, Date/Time, and the Content.
  - After that Users can also view previous entries and all of the entries.
  - The Diaries are stored in the local desktop _(C:/Data/diary.txt)_.
